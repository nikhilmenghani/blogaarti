#Sunsets
We are told that it's always nice to watch sunrises and sunsets to align our body with the nature's cycle. I am not a morning person currently but trying to become one. But, I try to watch sunsets though.
When I was watching the sunset today, I could see how beautiful it is. So going forward I won't go and watch sunset to maintain my health but to witness, feel and experience it's beauty.
In the rush to achieve materialistic things, we often forget to just take a moment and enjoy the present. We constantly try to fulfill our duties and work towards earning money. 
While no one understands that life is much more than that. It's about what we feel inside, not what we do outside.
